### Part 1: ExploreWeatherTrend
Analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends in Berlin where I live to overall global temperature trends
> Project: [Explore Weather Trend](https://github.com/lnphng/Data_Analyst/blob/master/1.ExploreWeatherTrend/Explore_Weather_Trend.pdf)

### Part 2: Investigate a Dataset
In this part, I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib and had an overview about the steps involved in a typical data analysis process. It was very interesting when I am able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code. Also very important that I learned how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings. In this part, I do project about Investigate TMDB Movies Dataset in order to answer some given questions. More details:

### Part 3: Practical Statistics
In this part, I have chance to review my knownledge about Descriptive Statistics, Probability, Hypothesis Testing, Multi Lineal Regression, Logistics Regressiion, and so on. In this part, I do the project about A/B Testing. A new web page is developed to try and increase the number of users who decide to buy for the company's product. For this project, I implemented A/B test for testing a new e-commerce website in order to decide that this new page should be implemented or the old page should be kept. More details:

### Part 4: Data Wrangling
In this project, I gathered, assessed, and cleaned data then acted on it through analysis, visualization and/or modeling.
It was interresting that, to gather the data we can do it automatically from Web. Also, I worked with a table full of image URL, and the data of retweet count and favorite count in order to analyze. More details:

### Part 5: 
In this part, I have learned alot visualizations in Python to build understanding of data.With appropriate plots, limits, transformations, and aesthetics to explore a dataset we can easy to explore the dataset. In addition, it was very nice to learn a new way to make a presentation with `nbconvert`. For the project in this part, I worked with Dataset Ford Gobike because bike sharing tends to become a trend nowsadays due to its enviroment friendly, and its good influences on keeping fit and healthy for people
